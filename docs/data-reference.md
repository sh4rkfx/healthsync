# Data reference

All files live in `data/` (or `HEALTHSYNC_DATA_DIR`). Locally that is the clone of the private
data repository; in the data repository itself they sit at the root. CSV files are UTF-8 with a
header row; empty fields mean the value was not available.

## garmin_daily.csv

One row per calendar day. Overnight values belong to the night that ends on this date.

| Column | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `date` | YYYY-MM-DD | Local calendar day |
| `weight_kg`, `fat_mass_kg`, `muscle_mass_kg`, `bone_mass_kg` | kg | First weigh-in of the day. `fat_mass_kg` is derived from weight and body fat % |
| `body_fat_pct`, `body_water_pct` | % | Bioimpedance estimates, use as weekly trends only |
| `bmi` | kg/m² | |
| `sleep_score` | 0–100 | |
| `sleep_hours` | h | Total sleep time |
| `sleep_start_local`, `sleep_end_local` | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Falling asleep and waking up in `HEALTHSYNC_TZ`. On travel days this is home time |
| `deep_sleep_min`, `light_sleep_min`, `rem_sleep_min`, `awake_min` | min | Sleep stages |
| `hrv_last_night_ms`, `hrv_weekly_avg_ms` | ms | Overnight HRV average and Garmin's 7-day average |
| `hrv_status` | text | e.g. `BALANCED`, `UNBALANCED`, `LOW` |
| `hrv_baseline_low_ms`, `hrv_baseline_high_ms` | ms | Garmin's personal balanced range |
| `resting_hr` | bpm | |
| `body_battery_wake` | 0–100 | At wake-up, if Garmin provides it |
| `body_battery_high`, `body_battery_low` | 0–100 | Daily maximum and minimum |
| `body_battery_charged`, `body_battery_drained` | points | Gained and used during the day |
| `stress_avg` | 0–100 | Empty if Garmin had too little data |
| `steps` | count | |
| `calories_total`, `calories_active` | kcal | Garmin's estimate of energy burned: total (resting + active) and active only |
| `readiness_score` | 0–100 | Morning value; Garmin recalculates readiness after activities |
| `readiness_level` | text | e.g. `HIGH`, `MODERATE`, `LOW` |

## garmin_activities.csv

One row per activity recorded on the watch.

| Column | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `date`, `start_time_local` | | Local date and time where the activity took place |
| `activity_id` | | Garmin Connect ID |
| `type` | text | Garmin type key, e.g. `bouldering`, `hiking`, `gravel_cycling`, `running`, `strength_training` |
| `name` | text | Activity name as shown in Garmin Connect |
| `duration_min`, `moving_min` | min | Total and moving time |
| `distance_km` | km | Empty for activities without distance |
| `elevation_gain_m` | m | |
| `avg_hr`, `max_hr` | bpm | |
| `calories` | kcal | |
| `training_load` | points | Garmin's EPOC-based load, comparable across sports |
| `aerobic_te`, `anaerobic_te` | 0–5 | Training Effect |
| `location` | text | If Garmin provides it |

Sport-specific details are not part of the activity list. For bouldering they are fetched
separately, see the next two files. `dump-raw` saves the full details of a day's activities.

## garmin_climbs.csv

One row per boulder logged on the watch in bouldering mode: grade chosen before the boulder,
LAP after it, then *Completed* or *Attempted*. Fetched per session from the activity's typed
splits (`CLIMB_ACTIVE`), so the `activities` source has to run first. Sessions of the last
`CLIMB_REFRESH_DAYS` (7) days are fetched again on every sync, because grades can still be
edited in Garmin Connect.

| Column | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `date`, `activity_id` | | Session the boulder belongs to |
| `climb_no` | | 1, 2, 3 … in the order climbed |
| `start_time_local` | | When the route timer started |
| `grade` | text | As shown on the watch, e.g. `6B+` or `V4` |
| `grade_scale` | text | Garmin's name of the grading system, e.g. `VERMIN` for the V scale |
| `grade_order` | | Garmin's sort order within the scale; higher is harder |
| `status` | text | `completed` (top) or `attempted` |
| `duration_s` | s | Route timer |
| `rest_after_s` | s | Rest until the next boulder; empty after the last one |
| `avg_hr`, `max_hr` | bpm | During the boulder |

A session recorded without LAP has a single split as long as the whole session, with the grade set
at the start and status `completed`. The dashboard treats splits longer than 15 minutes as such a
session, not as a boulder.

Garmin does not know which boulder in the gym an entry is. Three falls and a top on the same
boulder are four rows, and a repeat of a boulder from last week is a new row.

## garmin_climb_sessions.csv

One row per bouldering session, also for sessions without logged boulders.

| Column | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `date`, `activity_id`, `start_time_local` | | As in garmin_activities.csv |
| `climbs`, `completed`, `attempted` | count | Logged boulders, tops, attempts without top |
| `wall_s`, `rest_s` | s | Sum of route timers and of rests between boulders |
| `effort` | 1–10 | Perceived effort from the watch's self evaluation after saving; empty if skipped |
| `feel` | 0–100 | Feel from the same evaluation: 0 very weak, 25 weak, 50 normal, 75 strong, 100 very strong |

## hevy_sets.csv

One row per set.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `date` | Local calendar day of the workout start |
| `start_time` | Workout start, UTC, ISO 8601 |
| `workout_id`, `workout_title` | Title as set in Hevy, used by the dashboard to compare workouts |
| `exercise_index`, `exercise` | Position and name within the workout |
| `exercise_template_id` | Stable exercise ID; unlike the name it survives renames |
| `set_index`, `set_type` | `set_type` is `normal`, `warmup`, `dropset` or `failure`. Everything except `warmup` counts as a hard set |
| `weight_kg`, `reps`, `rpe` | |
| `duration_s`, `distance_m` | For timed or cardio sets |

The exercises „Handkraft rechts“ and „Handkraft links“ (`GRIP_EXERCISES` in `healthsync/config.py`) hold
grip-strength measurements, one set per try with the dynamometer reading as `weight_kg` and 1 rep.
They are left out of hard sets, tonnage and strength form in the analysis and the dashboard.

## nutrition_daily.csv

Optional, from YAZIO (unofficial app API). One row per day with at least one food or water entry;
days without entries have no row. Calories, protein, carbohydrates and fat are the sums over all
meals of the day.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `date` | Local calendar day |
| `calories_kcal` | Energy intake. Empty on days with water entries but no food |
| `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `fat_g` | Grams per day, rounded to 0.1 |
| `water_ml` | Logged water intake |

A partly logged day is indistinguishable from a day of low intake. The dashboard and the analysis
therefore treat days under 1,200 kcal (`MIN_COMPLETE_KCAL`) and the running day as not fully
logged and leave them out of means, the energy balance and the tests. Check the mapping against
your data with `python -m healthsync dump-yazio --date <day>` after the first login.
